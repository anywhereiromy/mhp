  subHeading: Alternative ways for the public to give money and reduce street begging
  body: Giving money to people begging on the street isnâ€™t an effective way to help individuals move away from sleeping rough, or address the complicated range of reasons which made them homeless. This action group is looking at alternative ways of giving via the Big Change fund, and will also raise public awareness on how to help including volunteering.
